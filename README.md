# 🚌 MetroPay A/B Testing — CUPED Variance Reduction

**Author:** Giorgi Shengelia  
**Date:** November 2025  

This repository contains a complete A/B testing analysis using **CUPED (Controlled Experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data)**  
to reduce variance and uncover small, meaningful treatment effects in a real-world-style dataset.

### 🧠 Highlights
- Cleaned and analyzed 10K+ user sessions from a checkout experiment.  
- Computed weekly **Conversion Rate (CR)** and **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**.  
- Applied **CUPED variance reduction**, revealing a **+0.4 pp lift** in conversion that became statistically significant (p ≈ 0.045).  
- Built reusable code blocks for A/B testing, Z-tests, and bootstrapped ARPU confidence intervals.
